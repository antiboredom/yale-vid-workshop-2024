How can code and automation help us see and manipulate large collections of videos in new ways? What do novel approaches in machine learning help make evident? On the flip side, what do these same approaches prevent us from seeing? What do they obscure? How can automated "content generation" be leveraged for political, poetic, and critical ends? In this workshop, attendees will use Python in conjunction with basic command line tools to explore the possibilities (and limitations) of manipulating, analyzing, filtering, editing, and composing video with code. The workshop will treat video as a textual as well as a visual medium, and focus on repurposing found footage to generate new compositions and narratives.
